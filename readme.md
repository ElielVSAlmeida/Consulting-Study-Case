After careful analysis and reading of the features need and problems faced by the "company" and it's data, it is noted that a E-commerce acting as a old wholesale clunky company would face big bottle necks in it's process, with a small change it is possible to make big moves. As we can see with the invoicing area and it's barriers and was the key part for the problem to spread to other roles.

Changing it from *Order to Delivery to Cash* to *Order to Payment to Delivery* or *'Order to Cash to Delivery'* is the key move to make real automation and fix all bottle necks and barries.
